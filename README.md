# Poverty

#Summary 
The purpose of this data module project is to teach students how to tell stories based on poverty statistics and consider how politics can influence this reporting. Additionally, the students should learn some basic data managment techniques related to the Multidimensional Poverty Index and make presentations/visualizations based on that metadata. This data module is part of the collaborative effort of students at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. Researchers tasked with creating the "Poverty" data module are Thomas Boswell, Nishat Tasnim, and Anne Ortman. 

#Work and Locations 
All work began in February 2021. All data and scripts used to aquire and clean the data can be found in the Global-Development-and-Politics-of-Data/poverty main repository. Data is located in the data folder while scripts used in R to clean the data can be found in the Scripts folder. 

#Accompanying Materials
The Data Module has student facing and researcher/professor facing materials. All student facing materials will be found in the student folder of the poverty zip file. Go here to access the datasets necessary for the project. Those working on the data module should have first read Chapter 4 of the Global Development textbook as well as the Data Module manuscript that outlines key practices employed in our module creation process. 

#Instructions
There are a series of raw and tidied datasets in this repository. Raw datasets have a ".raw" designation and should not be saved over. You will be explicitly told when save any datasets and will always use a new designation like "tidy" or "analysis" that you can add to the end of the file.
